It covers Antarctic paleoclimatology, sedimentology, remote sensing, and data validation techniques to enhance satellite-derived rainfall accuracy, particularly in complex terrains. Hydrometeorology, climatology, and statistical evaluations of satellite-based precipitation datasets are explored for improved rainfall estimates. Geospatial analysis also addresses accessibility issues in healthcare. Mineral exploration focuses on geoheritage, petrology, and economic mineralization. Environmental studies investigate microplastic pollution in ecosystems, analytical techniques in environmental monitoring, submarine groundwater discharge, and biogeochemistry in fishing zones. Additionally, geotechnical, GIS, and geostatistical methods are applied to civil and environmental engineering challenges. Other areas of focus include environmental management, waste treatment, methane emission monitoring, and improving energy equity through measurements of household energy usage and sustainable construction materials.",
